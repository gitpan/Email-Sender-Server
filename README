DESCRIPTION
    Email::Sender::Server is designed to provide a simple API for sending
    emails from your applications in a non-blocking fashion. It accomplishes
    this by separating the email creation and delivery events, thus email
    delivery becomes eventual in-that email messages are not required to be
    delivered immediately.

    This is very much a work in-progress, more documentation soon to come,
    see Email::Sender::Server::Client for more usage exmaples.

METHODS
  run
    The run method is used to execute Email::Sender::Server::Controller
    commands. Most commands exit abruptly and prints to STDOUT. This method
    is intended to be used by a command-line interface.

        use Email::Sender::Server;

        # start the server with 1 worker
        Email::Sender::Server::run('start', 'worker:1');
